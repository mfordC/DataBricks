# DataBricks

Code by Matt Ford
Datasets from kaggle.com

The purpose of this code was to combine two datasets using Spark
I chose Fifa19 player data and Football events data
Fifa19 has many statistic values for each player but does not have # of goals
Football events data has # of goals and info about the games
The data can be merged in order to see what trends there are between various player attributes and # of goals

First the 3 commands in Soccer.py are executed
Then the SQL queries in Soccer_Queries.hql are executed

Note that this was run on DataBricks
